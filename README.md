A **realistic mock REST API** designed to simulate the data infrastructure used in a **political campaign war-room analytics dashboard**.

The project generates a structured synthetic dataset representing how modern election campaigns manage:

- booth-level operations
- volunteer coordination
- voter outreach
- issue tracking
- influencer networks
- opposition monitoring

The API is powered by **json-server** and a dataset generator built using **@faker-js/faker**, allowing frontend developers to build **analytics dashboards and campaign monitoring interfaces without requiring a production backend**.

# 💡 Why This Project Exists

Many frontend dashboards require realistic backend data for development and testing.

However, most public datasets do not simulate **operational campaign data structures** such as booth management, volunteer deployment, and voter sentiment reporting.

This project was created to provide a **realistic mock backend for campaign analytics dashboards**, enabling developers to build data-driven interfaces without relying on production systems.
